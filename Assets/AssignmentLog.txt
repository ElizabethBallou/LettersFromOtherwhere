You take a picture of it so you can remember it later, but the picture doesn't show anything. What date did you see in the smoke? Why do you think it doesn't appear in pictures? Addressee name: Maren

You trip and drop your phone, and hairline cracks spread across the surface. But the words underneath aren't just distorted. Now, they're in someone else's handwriting - the handwriting of someone who has sent you a letter recently. Whose handwriting do you see? What does it tell you to do?
