While taking a walk in Prospect Park, you saw some decorative urns with sculpted snakes as handles. When you got close, the snakes came alive and whispered something to you.	What did they say? How did you feel? Excited? Scared?
You were watching TV when the screen flickered and went dark. Then it lit up again with a map of the New York City subway system. Except – there was a new line on the subway, one you knew didn’t exist. It was called the July Line.	Where did the July Line go?
Last night, the doorbell rang. When you answered the door, there was an animal from the Prospect Park Zoo. The animal said it was in danger and needed a safe place to stay for a while.	What animal was it? Did you let it in, or turn it away?
This morning, when you turned on the faucet in the bathroom, strange coins rushed out instead of water. The coins were very old, and the words engraved in the metal were in a language you didn’t recognize.	What image was engraved on the heads side? What about the tail side? Did you try to buy anything with it?
A package arrived, addressed to you! But it wasn’t one you ordered. You opened it up anyway and discovered a compass inside. The needle did not point north, as needles on compasses usually do.	What direction did it point? Where did that direction lead? Who do you think sent you the compass?
A few nights ago, an owl appeared outside the window. It hooted softly, then sang a song you recognized.	What song did it sing? What did the song sound like? Why did the owl pick that song?
